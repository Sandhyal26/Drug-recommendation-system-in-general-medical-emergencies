# Drug-recommendation-system-in-general-medical-emergencies

* Developed an end-to-end machine learning–based drug recommendation system to assist clinical decision-making in general medical emergencies. The system analyzes patient symptoms and medical history to recommend appropriate medications with improved accuracy and reliability.

* Designed and implemented data preprocessing pipelines to clean and standardize healthcare datasets.

* Built and trained classification models using Python and scikit-learn to map symptoms to recommended drugs.

* Applied feature engineering and model evaluation techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

* Implemented modular, reusable code following clean coding practices.

Demonstrated real-world application of data-driven logic, algorithmic thinking, and backend processing.
